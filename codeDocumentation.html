	<h1 id = "title"> Code Documentation for my Outlook .pst Copy Script </h1>
	<h2 id = "author"> By: Tyler Dickard </h2>
	<h3 id = "Add-Types"> Add-Types </h3>
	<p>
		This revised version of the script utilizes the Add-Types System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing to create the form and all of its objects.
		These modules will replace the need to use an XAML file to create a GUI to interact with.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "7ZipCheck"> 7Zip4Powershell Check </h3>
	<p>
		So, right after the Add-Types, I have a check to install the module that I am using for this compression. 7Zip4Powershell is a module that allows
		me to compress files more effectively and with a wider range of file sizes compared to the built-in compression method. This check will query the system on
		what are the currently installed modules for Powershell are installed. If the query doesn't return 7Zip4Powershell it will automatically install it before proceeding
		with the script.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "networkCheck"> Network Check </h3>
	<p>
		After the 7Zip4Powershell check I have an automatic check to confirm that the user is connected to the internet. This is just a simple check that pings a 
		server and waits for it to return the ping. If the ping fails it will stop execution of the script due to the script needing an internet connection.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "GUI"> GUI </h3>
	<p>
		The GUI for this script is simple and clean for one main reason, simplicity to avoid human error. This script has two radio buttons, one for upload and one for download. Once the user checks which operation they are doing
		it will do that operation. The GUI also has a method defined in it so that it will always appear ontop of any window open on the users machine.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "transferButton">The Transfer Button</h3>
	<p>
		Once this button is pressed it will check if the textboxes have input in them. If they all have input it will initiate the transfer process. When the button is pressed
		it will set the result variable to OK which will allow the script to continue to execute.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "transferProcess">The Transfer Process</h3>
	<p>
		For the transfer process I have found a method around having to avoid OneDrive. Since we are using compression, we can upload the .zip to OneDrive with the .pst file inside of it to make it easier
		to transfer without the use of a local admin. This makes the process self-service. But to start with this process, for uploading, the script will check the users documents folder, and the appdata folder
		to check for the .pst file, if neither of those locations have a .pst file it will throw an error. But, once it finds the file it will then compress the file into a .zip named outlookArchive.zip and then upload it
		to the users OneDrive - MMO folder. Then when the user runs the download portion of the script it will then pull that .zip file down from OneDrive and extract the .zip into the appdata location for the user to import the data.
